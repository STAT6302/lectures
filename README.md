# lectures

This repository holds the lecture notes for the class. Be aware that I may update the lecture notes after they are posted. Periodically check the the most recent commit date and comment to see if you have the most recent version. A better strategy would be the use github to update your local version of the repository (e.g. git pull).

# Class Schedule
